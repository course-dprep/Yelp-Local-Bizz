# Yelp Review project
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into online review systems and their implications for both consumers and businesses. 

## Motivation for the project
 Due to the evolving nature of consumer perceptions, businesses increasingly rely on online reputation as a
 critical determinant of their success. It has been suggested that online consumer reviews serve as a substitute
 for traditional forms of reputation [Luca, 2016](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/12-016_a7e4a5a2-03f9-490d-b093-8f951238dba2.pdf). 
 For business owners, it is important to understand the  influence of these reviews on consumer perceptions, 
 as different consumer segments may interpret reviews in distinct ways. 
 These varying perceptions can further shape the decision-making processes of potential customers, 
 thereby reinforcing or altering a businessâ€™s overall reputation. Through a systematic analysis
 of Yelp data, this study aims to identify patterns that explain the extent to which online reviews impact
 business reputation.

## Data
For this project, we have chosen to work with the Yelp data set. The Yelp data set provides a rich and
 extensive collection of real-world business reviews, making it an ideal choice for analyzing consumer behavior, rating dynamics, and its effect on consumer perception of businesses. 
 With millions of reviews from diverse businesses across different locations, it offers a valuable opportunity to study patterns in customer
 feedback and the factors affecting business reputation. Additionally, the data set includes information on
 user characteristics, such as elite status, enabling a detailed investigation into how different types of reviewers
 impact business ratings.
